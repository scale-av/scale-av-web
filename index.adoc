SCALE A/V is the team that handles A/V for the http://socallinuxexpo.org[Southern California Linux Expo], an open source conference.

We consist of volunteers.  The main perks for volunteers include free admission to SCALE, learning new things, getting the bird's eye view of the conference.  And meals are covered for your shifts.

There are many volunteer opportunities for people of any skill level before, during, and after the conference.

If you are interested in volunteering with us,

This form asks a number of questions specific to the A/V team and helps us gauge your skills, interests, and availability.

== volunteer timeline

* Most of the before-SCALE activities involve software development and hardware hacking in addition to the usual planning.
* Tues night,Wed,  we will be setting up the conference rooms and the A/V command center.
* Thu-Sun,  we will be focused on live video and audio production and troubleshooting.  Volunteer hours are 9-7pm, but A/V support may be required for some evening events.  (NOTE: you are not expected to work the whole day, just whatever times you can manage.)
* Sun, once the conference is over,  we could use all the help we can get for tear down.  Most talks will be over by 5:30pm, but we can probably begin teardown of rooms that are no longer being used.
* After, we will have a post-mortem and finish up with any video editing tasks needed to get all the videos uploaded to Youtube.
