* [ ] Place the computer on the shelf of the speaker’s podium.

cables running that are not in the way of the speaker and not a rats nest. 
Do not allow wires to dangle.

* [ ] Connect the Ethernet cable labeled “AV” coming from the network
switch into the PC Ethernet jack. The other Ethernet cable labeled “Speaker” is
for Presenter's Laptop use. If the Ethernet cables are not already plugged into
the network switch, you will need to connect the cables to the switches.
Use an empty port in the AV VLAN range (22-27, confirm with diagram posted on Switch)

Speaker’s Laptop HDMI/VGA/Audio cable to the HDMI In jack.

will light up green. If the computer does not come on, wait 45 seconds, watching the
LCD screen on the front panel to see if penguins display on the screen.

at the inner motherboard through the clear right side wall of the computer.
You should see both a solid blue Link light and a flashing orange Activity light from the right.

 TIP: The light is located roughly underneath the penguin logo etched on top of the box.

* [ ] Test the KVM Video Switch by pressing the pushbutton on the KVM remote.
Each time you press the remote, one of two lights near the bottom
of the front of the computer will turn on, indicating which source is active.

* [ ] Tape the Laminated Speaker Reminder Flyer to the top of the podium.

* [ ] Tape the KVM switch about 6 inches from the bottom edge of the podium
towards the left edge of the top of the podium.

* [ ] Tape down the *HDMI Adapters Cable Set*, leaving enough slack in the cable
on the side with the adapters so that the presenter can comfortably plug the
adapters into their laptop.
